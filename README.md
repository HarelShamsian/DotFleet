# DotFleet
DotFleet is a simple console-based Battleship-style game written in C++. The player guesses hidden ship locations on a square grid until all three ships are found. The game board is defined by #define N, which sets the number of cells. By default, N is set to 16, representing a 4x4 grid. You can easily change the board size by modifying this value in the code, just make sure that N is a perfect square (like 9, 16, 25, etc.) so the board displays correctly. Ships are placed randomly each game, and the player inputs numbers (0 to N-1) to try and find them. Hits reveal an 'X', while misses show an empty space. The game tracks the number of guesses and ends once all ships are found.
